Simply search for the plugin name via the **Plugins -> Add New** dialog and click install, or download and extract the plugin, and copy the plugin folder into your wp-content/plugins directory and activate.

After installation create a new post or edit an existing one using Gutenberg editor, and when adding a new block, look under  **WPZOOM - Recipe Card** section to find these 2 blocks.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Make sure you haven't disabled the new block editor using the Classic Editor plugin, as these blocks work only with the new editor.
